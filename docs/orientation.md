## Orientation Notes

One of the major pain points of setting up a Biplanar X-ray to 3D Segmentation dataset is to maintain orientation of the predicted segmentation and the groundtruth orientation.

Here, we assume that the Biplanar X-ray are in standing left-to-right, anterior-to-posterior orientation.
